# Customer_Segmentation_project
Developed Customer Segmentation Model for Targeted Marketing and Personalized Experiences

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used in the field of marketing to divide a customer base into distinct groups or segments based on shared characteristics, behaviors, and preferences. These segments enable businesses to gain valuable insights into their customers and tailor their strategies to effectively target each group.

In this project, I will explore customer segmentation in the online retailer. The project includes a structured approach, starting with data loading and exploration, followed by data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation techniques, segment profiling, and interpretation. Throughout the process, I will utilize Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling tasks.
